# CodeCompiler

CodeCompiler is a Python-based utility designed to assist developers in compiling and running scripts efficiently on Windows platforms. It supports Python, Java, and C++ scripts, enabling developers to enhance their productivity by quickly compiling and executing code.

## Features

- Compile and run Python scripts.
- Compile and run Java files.
- Compile and run C++ files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java files
- g++ compiler for C++ files

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. For Java files, install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and ensure `javac` is in your system's PATH.
3. For C++ files, install the g++ compiler and ensure it is in your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `code_compiler.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python code_compiler.py
   ```

4. Enter the path to your script when prompted.

## Example

To compile and run a Python script:

1. Place your Python script (e.g., `script.py`) in a known directory.
2. Run the `code_compiler.py` and input the path to `script.py`.

The program will automatically detect the file type and execute the appropriate commands to compile and run the script.
